# Next-Word-Predictor
## Introduction to this Project 
As we all know that whenever we search something on browser, youtube, facebook, instagram, etc. It start predicting some related sentences or phrases. This project is all about to learn how to predict the same or you can say next related word from the dataset 'gutenberg_books.txt' file. You can get in online.
# important Libraries
- tensorflow
- keras
- pickle
- numpy
- os

# Download DataSet:
Dataset is provide with this project itself. else you can download: https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top

# We have used LSTM 
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is specifically designed to handle sequential data, such as time series, speech, and text. LSTM networks are capable of learning long-term dependencies in sequential data, which makes them well suited for tasks such as language translation, speech recognition, and time series forecasting.

# THE CODE THAT I HAVE UPLOADED HERE IS WITHOUT THE TRAINED MODEL SO, YOU NEED TO TRAIN THE MODEL BY YOUR OWN.

# Applications:
- Optimized search
